# Regression-Models-Analysis

In this repo, as asked by my mentor, I am going to take a look at about four types of regression models and sample them on data from yahoo finance.

I am also learning from the literature review made [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). I have read through the documentation and realized there is a lot I can learn from here that I had not considered.

The notebooks will be written simply will little or no complexity such that anyone can understand them perfectly.

Good luck!

Any contributions are well appreciated.
